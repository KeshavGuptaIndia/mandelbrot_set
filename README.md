This program generates images of a specified region of the mandelbrot set.
The folder of the executable mandel.exe should contain an input file named "inp.txt".
Each line of the input file should conatain one command in the following format:
\<output filename\> \<image width\> \<image height\> \<real axis min\> \<real axis max\> \<imag. axis min\> \<imag. axis max\> \<iterations\> \<red\> \<blue\> \<green\>

Due to a quartic polynomial shading meethod, currently the images ten to have a purple-ish shade. I'm working on that as of now.
Feel free to suggest any other methods for shading. Email me at info@keshlabs.in

I have included a sample "inp.txt" file. It produces 6 sample images. 

Hope you like my work :)
